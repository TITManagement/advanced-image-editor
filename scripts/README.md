# Scripts directory
This directory contains execution scripts organized by purpose:

- `experiments/` - Data science experiment scripts (preprocessing, training, evaluation)
- `etl/` - Extract, Transform, Load scripts for data processing

These scripts should use the contracts defined in `/contracts/` for consistent data structures.
